## Description

Faster is a user-friendly application that connects individuals who need errands done by reliable deliverers within their local area. This app aims to simplify daily tasks by offering a platform for posting, accepting, and fulfilling errand requests with ease. Unlike other currently existing food delivery apps like UberEats and DoorDash, Faster focuses on simple daily delivery requests. A request can be as simple as delivering an envelope or a plot of flowers. Faster allows users to have a larger flexibility in describing what they want deliverers to deliver and how deliverers deliver.
